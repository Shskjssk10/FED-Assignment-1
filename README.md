# FED-Assignment-1 

https://shskjssk10.github.io/FED-Assignment-1/

The focus of this project is to give Singapore's Saizeriya counterpart website a more professional and inviting look. 

With 80 years of history on its back, Saizeriya has come a long way from its humble beginnings in Ichikawa. Saizeriya Singapore, like all the other global
outlets, is well known for its family-friendly atmosphere, and Italian menu serving a variety of pizzas, pastas and main courses. It is only acceptable that
its website reflects that. However, Singapore’s Saizeriya website does not, and in fact is quite amateur. While the website’s UX is average, its UI on the
other hand seems ‘homemade’. The aesthetic of the website does not reflect the warmth of the company’s brand, but instead rubs off as unprofessional.

## Design Process

The design process behind this project is to improve the UI of the website. As mentioned, the UX is alright and sufficient, the main improvement is on the 
website's professional look. This new revamped website is meant for everyone of all ages, particularly targetting the younger generations as they are more
appealed to websites that look better. 

## Features

My website features seven pages: 
- Home Page - Shares the company's philosophy and updates such as the new store that opened in Alexandra Retail Centre
- About Us - Shares the company's aim, concept and brief history.
- Menu - Shares the company's menu in a very user friendly way, offering the option to download as well.
- Quality - Shares how the company upholds its quality.
- Find&Contact - Shows the different locations of the outlets in Singapore
- Career - Shows the career opportunities in the company.
- Feedback - Allows users to send in feedback.

Comparing to the current Singapore Saizeriya website, these are the changes that have been implemented:
1) Improved Navigational Panel and Footer
2) Improved Consistency of Banners
3) Improved Viewing of Menu
4) Improved Icons
5) Improved 'CAREER' Page
6) Implemented 'FEEDBACK' Page

An additional feature that was not implemented but could be in the future would be a page to order food online, such as
the Mcdonald's app. This would have been especially useful but was not achieved due to lack of time and clear images that 
could be used as they were all either of poor quality or not available. 

The wireframe can be found in the folder named 'Wireframe'

## Technologies Used

HTML, CSS and JS were used to code the entire website. 

## Testing

There are two things that mainly needed testing: 

### Responsiveness
1. Decrease and increase viewport width to check if elements of the website were responsive.
2. Especially checked if navigation and footer panel's elements disappeared when hitting a certain width, while the hamburger menu appear in the navigation
   panel at the top.

To further elaborate on responsiveness. Elements' 'flex-direction' would be set to 'column' after a certain width as it would transition to a mobile phone 
POV, which is not wide enough to show a desktop' POV, otherwise the text would be too small to read. 

### Feedback Form
1. Went to 'FEEDBACK' page
2. Try to submit empty form and verify that an error message about the required field appears.
3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears.
4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears. 

Currently, my website is fully functional apart from a single bug. It is on the 'FEEDBACK' page. After clicking submit, while the values are logged into the 
local storage, the page does not refresh and has to be manually refreshed in other for the contentes to be viewed at the bottom. Unfortunate that I am not 
able to address this before the deadline is up.
