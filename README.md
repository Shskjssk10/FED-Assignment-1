# FED-Assignment-1 ()

The focus of this project is to give Singapore's Saizeriya counterpart website a more professional and inviting look. 

With 80 years of history on its back, Saizeriya has come a long way from its humble beginnings in Ichikawa. Saizeriya Singapore, like all the other global
outlets, is well known for its family-friendly atmosphere, and Italian menu serving a variety of pizzas, pastas and main courses. It is only acceptable that
its website reflects that. However, Singapore’s Saizeriya website does not, and in fact is quite amateur. While the website’s UX is average, its UI on the
other hand seems ‘homemade’. The aesthetic of the website does not reflect the warmth of the company’s brand, but instead rubs off as unprofessional.

## Design Process ()

The design process behind this project is to improve the UI of the website. As mentioned, the UX is alright and sufficient, the main improvement is on the 
website's professional look. This new revamped website is meant for everyone of all ages, particularly targetting the younger generations as they are more
appealed to websites that look better.
